# Flight Fare Prediction 

#Overview
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts flight ticket prices based on different input features likee airline, source, destination, number of stops, and journey date.
The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, model saving, and deployment using Streamlit.
